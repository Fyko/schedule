This bot will autonomously post announcements and reminders 10 minutes before the next period starts on what period it is and when it starts.

## How it works
A cronjob will fire every day at 6:30 am, where it will send the initial tweet for the day. At the scheduled time for each reminder, a reply will be added to the initial tweet.

## Delays
The initial tweet providing the schedule images is fired at 06:30 when the cronjob is ran.
The bot will reply to the main tweet 10 minutes before the time of the next period / block.
